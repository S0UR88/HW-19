            On April 26, 2019, a beluga whale appeared near Tufjord, a village in northern Norway, immediately alarming fishermen in the area. Belugas in that part of the world typically inhabit the remote Arctic and are rarely spotted as far south as the Norwegian mainland. Although they occasionally travel solo, they tend to live and move in groups. This particular whale was entirely alone and unusually comfortable around humans, trailing boats and opening his mouth as though expecting to be fed. And he seemed to be tangled in rope.

When a commercial fisherman named Joar Hesten got a closer look, he realized that the whale was in fact wearing a harness: one strap girdling his neck and another gripping his torso just behind his flippers. Hesten contacted a local scientist, and word eventually reached the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, which dispatched an inspector, Jorgen Ree Wiig. After several failed attempts by Wiig and a colleague to free the beluga while onboard a dinghy, Hesten put on an immersion suit and plunged into the water. Though the whale was not quite as hefty as an average adult male of his species, he was still a formidable presence, by best estimates close to 14 feet long and about 2,700 pounds. Swimming beside him, Hesten managed to unclasp one of the straps. Together, they used a grappling-hook-like device to remove the rest of the stubborn harness.

A few days later, the beluga followed a boat to Hammerfest, one of the northernmost towns in the world, where he took up residence, frequently interacting with people in the harbor. News of the friendly white whale spread quickly. In early May, a video of the beluga went viral, eventually earning a spot on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” In it, several young women stand on a dock in Hammerfest, speaking excitedly with their hands outstretched just above the water. The beluga levitates to the surface in an upright position, as smooth, plump and silent as a balloon. There is something in his mouth — something rectangular. “Oh, my God!” one woman exclaims as the whale returns a smartphone her friend dropped in the sea. The women cheer and caress the whale, whose mouth continues to hang open. Later viral videos would show him stealing (and returning) a kayaker’s GoPro and playing fetch with a rugby ball. By midsummer, he had become an international celebrity, drawing large groups of tourists.

All the while, marine experts had been speculating about the whale’s origin. Clearly this animal had spent time in captivity — but where? The first major clues came from the harness: One of its plastic buckles was embossed with the words “Equipment St. Petersburg.” And it appeared to have a camera mount, hinting at reconnaissance of some kind. The beluga also knew how to closely follow boats and had a habit of wrapping rope around propellers, which could suggest specialized training. As several experts told media outlets at the time, the whale had most likely escaped from the nearby Russian Navy. Based on a poll of more than 25,000 respondents, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation christened the beluga Hvaldimir, a portmanteau of hval, the Norwegian word for whale, and the Russian name Vladimir.

The military conscription of a beluga whale might sound like a conceit plucked from less-than-convincing spy fiction, but it is actually a well-documented practice. Since the 1960s, Russia and the United States have trained dolphins, seals and other marine mammals to assist their naval forces by tagging enemy divers, detecting mines and recovering items from the seafloor. Satellite photos of Russian naval bases near Murmansk, not far from the spot where Norwegian fishermen first found Hvaldimir, reveal the type of sea pens often used to hold belugas. Audun Rikardsen, a professor of marine biology at the Arctic University of Norway, told me that international contacts have since confirmed that Hvaldimir belonged to the navy.

In the years since Hvaldimir first entered the global spotlight, the very qualities that make him so endearing — his intelligence, curiosity and charisma — have put him in perpetual danger. While traveling along the coasts of Norway and Sweden, he has inadvertently hooked himself on fishing lines and suffered multiple gashes caused by boat strikes. Incessant chewing of ropes and chains has worn his teeth to nubs. Overzealous spectators have swarmed him for photos, prodded him with brooms and thrown rocks in his vicinity to draw his attention. Some Norwegians have threatened to seek warrants to shoot and kill the beluga because he has damaged salmon farms or other underwater structures.

Hvaldimir is now at the center of a dispute over his welfare. Although he has become more independent since his early residence in Hammerfest, he has not completely relinquished human companionship. He has retained enough survival skills to feed himself, yet he has also ventured into warmer waters where there are no belugas, insufficient food and numerous threats. Even as he swims freely through the ocean, he is caught in a tangle of conflicting human ambitions, some noble, others misguided, nearly all distorted by inadequate understanding. Whether to intervene, and how to do so, remain contentious subjects among scientists, activists and government officials.

Restaurant menus can be surprisingly revealing. Sure, they’ll tell you what you can order at the hottest restaurant in your city on a particular evening. But they’re also a time capsule of culture, reflecting the comforts, habits, flavors and values of an era.

That’s been true since the first American menus of the 1840s, which cataloged the opulent dishes at hotels catering to the ultrawealthy. And it remains so, well into the age of QR-code fatigue.

Last year, as the New York Times Food team traveled the country to scout candidates for our annual list of favorite restaurants, we also set out to understand, more broadly, what defines eating out today.

After years of plexiglass dividers, curbside delivery, masked servers and, yes, QR codes, one thing was immediately clear: Physical menus aren’t just back. They have more personality than ever.

We visited hundreds of restaurants of varying styles, cuisines and price points — and left with 121 menus in hand. Together, they provide a snapshot of the distinctive new shape of dining right now.<br>


Cutouts, abstract shapes and line drawings inspired by artists like Henri Matisse and Jean Cocteau pop up all over these menus. But many restaurants have gone beyond simple illustrations, representing themselves with a mascot, usually an adorable animal or food item.

Like fashion labels, “restaurants have become brands,” said Ms. Polonsky. “People are tired of having logos everywhere, but having an icon is a way to be distinctive but not too obvious.”

Informal is in.
Cheesy fonts, wonky formatting, basic printer paper, a slightly messier look: Some menus look as if they were created by a design-school freshman. And that’s the point.

“It is intentionally done where it feels less formal and way more approachable,” said Badal Patel, a designer in Los Angeles. Making menus that don’t look pristine, she added, conveys “more of a humanness.”

The humanity’s in the details.
Another way restaurants remind us of the people behind them: subtle, analog touches like stamps, wax seals, handwriting or embossing.

With Border Deal Near, Parole and Money Take Center Stage in Senate Talks
Republicans and Democrats have agreed to try to reduce the number of migrants granted parole to stay in the United States, but cementing the compromise will take money and persuasion on both sides.

A bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a compromise to crack down on the surge of migrants across the United States border with Mexico, including reducing the number who are allowed to live and work in the country temporarily, but a final deal depends on resolving critical funding disputes.

Much of the recent haggling over the emerging agreement — and a point of contention for its critics — has been about how to limit the number of people who are granted parole, a status that allows migrants without visas to live and work in the United States temporarily. Drawing broader support for the plan in the Senate would clear away the biggest obstacle to congressional approval of tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression, which Republicans have said they will block absent a deal to clamp down at the border.

The G.O.P. considers parole a dangerous loophole that fuels illegal immigration and must be tightly closed. To many Democrats, it is a crucial tool that allows the administration to treat desperate migrants humanely, which must be preserved, particularly for vulnerable populations fleeing failing states and war.

Bridging the gap will likely hinge on the two sides agreeing on how much federal money to spend to try to decrease net immigration numbers, and persuading Republicans that the deal’s measures will be effective. On Monday, Senate leaders warned that getting a final deal depended on resolving those remaining differences.

“It’s certainly not a done deal yet; there are a handful of issues that have not yet been agreed to,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on the floor. “On something as complicated as the border, it’s not just what we do that matters. It’s how we do it.”

Here’s how parole works, and why it’s central to sealing any border deal in Congress.

Parole is a stopgap measure for migrants without legal status.
Parole authority, which has existed since the 1950s, allows the government to extend migrants a special status to remain in the United States for a certain period of time. It was designed to be used only in cases of humanitarian need, or if there was a public benefit to allowing a migrant into the country.

But administrations have interpreted that guidance in different ways, sometimes ushering in whole groups of migrants under the authority.

The Biden administration also paroled in roughly a million migrants under a number of programs geared toward helping specific vulnerable groups, such as people fleeing the war in Ukraine and the Taliban government in Afghanistan, as well as migrants from economically devastated countries like Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua who have sponsors already in the United States. Republicans have sought to limit nearly all of those programs.

According to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, the use of parole authority to allow otherwise inadmissible migrants into the United States has also ballooned under the Biden administration, though the percentage of those admitted is roughly comparable to intake figures seen under President Barack Obama and during the early part of the Trump administration.

Republicans have railed against what they call the practice of “catch and release,” in which migrants are briefly detained upon their arrival into the United States but then quickly granted parole and released to await immigration court hearings.

Republicans and Democrats have agreed to steps they argue will result in fewer grants of parole.
The emerging Senate deal seeks to reduce parole numbers by tightening immigration enforcement and speeding up processing. It would make it harder for migrants to claim asylum, expand detention capacity in the United States and expedite the expulsion of migrants who lack lawful reasons to stay in the country.

The plan would also add staff to the Border Patrol and asylum officer corps tasked with processing migrants through the immigration intake and court systems. And it includes a fail-safe mechanism that would shut down migrant intake altogether if the system became overwhelmed, a level that officials put at more than 5,000 daily encounters with people trying to cross the border. In November, daily encounters at the southwest border averaged above 8,000 per day, according to statistics published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and last month, encounters peaked at over 12,000 per day, according to reports.

Proponents contend that those measures would effectively reduce the number of migrants who would need to be granted parole. But Republicans have sought a hard cap on the number of migrants who can receive parole, as well as the elimination of group-based parole. The deal does not include either.

Cash is key to sealing the deal.
The compromise under discussion turns on an elusive agreement on funding.

Negotiators believe that if they secure substantial money for the beefed-up enforcement and processing powers they have agreed upon, parole numbers will decline without the hard caps that Republicans have demanded.

But lawmakers are still bargaining over how much money must be included to do that job. If they cannot reach agreement, the compromise could collapse.

Republicans want stricter limits on parole.
House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, have threatened to block any deal that does not eviscerate most group-based parole programs and reinstitute a policy of keeping migrants who cannot be held in detention facilities on the Mexican side of the border. In recent weeks, Republicans in both chambers have also rallied around demands for strict numerical annual caps for parole, calling that a “red line” to ensure that the president cannot abuse his parole authority.

“None of us trust the Biden administration to implement the law,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters last week. “So there needs to be a hard cap on parole.” Mr. Graham is not a participant in the bipartisan negotiations, but his support is considered critical for rallying other Republicans around an eventual bill.

Democrats have resisted limiting parole.
For the most part, Democrats regard parole as an important tool for managing an often chaotic situation at the border and the limitations of U.S. detention facilities and immigration court backlogs. They also fear what might happen to vulnerable populations like Afghans and Ukrainians if the president’s ability to offer parole to groups fleeing acute humanitarian crises were scaled back, or capped at a low threshold.

While many Democrats have rallied around the idea of reducing the influx of migrants unlawfully trying to enter the United States, they have balked at the Republican demands to directly limit parole authority.

And some progressive Democrats say any deal that tries to reduce parole numbers by tightening restrictions on migrants, including shutting down intake if the number of border crossings exceeds a certain level, is unacceptable.

Stand aside for others when using escalator

The multi-storey metro stations rely on escalators to get passengers from one floor to the other fast. However, in a station, some people may be in more of a hurry than others, so for those using escalators, it's important that they keep some space open for those in a rush. The escalators are marked in yellow, and as long as commuters stay on the left side of the escalators, inside the yellow marks, the right side will remain open for passengers in a rush to walk up or down the moving escalators. To ensure this, it's important to avoid standing side by side or in a circle on escalators when travelling in groups.

Keeping the entryways and exits clear

The compartment doors, and the platform screens in between trains and <br>
platforms need to be kept clear or any obstacles at all times. Inside the train, passengers should keep their hands away from the compartment doors. On the platform, passengers must not keep their hands on the platform screens, they are not allowed to lean on them, they are not allowed to peek over them to look at the incoming trains. In fact, passengers waiting on the platforms are supposed to stand behind the yellow line, away from the platform screens.

Get on and off trains in a systematic way

When getting on and off trains, it is important to avoid collisions. For this, following the marks on the platform floors, those getting off the trains should stay in the middle part of the doorway, while those getting on the trains need to line up behind the left and right edges of the doorway. Obstructing the doorway, or taking too much time, or standing there when the train is full and pushing to make space is not allowed.

The first compartment is reserved for women

To ensure a safe and smooth journey for women on the metro, the first car of every train has been reserved for women. It means men are not allowed on the first car, but it also means that in the other compartments, the space still needs to be shared by men and women. It is important to be respectful to people of all genders when using the metro rail, as well as in all walks of life.

No eating in the compartment

Eating inside the compartment is a problem as it may lead to the smell of food getting trapped inside the controlled environment of the train. Besides, in a heavily crowded moving train, eating is risky, as spills become likely, and when a spill does happen, it may affect a lot of people.

Share seats and space, be considerate to those with special needs<br>

Passengers should not take up more space than they require inside trains. Especially when seated, one person covering the space where two people can sit is a terrible act considering most people don't even get the chance to sit down. If someone with a physical disability, special need, a pregnant woman or an elderly person is seen standing inside the compartment, it is basic decency to offer them a seat if possible. Carrying oversized bags and heavy luggage is also not allowed on the metro.

Pay attention to the public announcements

In metro stations, the public announcement (PA) systems are constantly passing on valuable information and instruction to passengers. Listening to the PA and following their instructions are easy ways of making sure you are following all the necessary metro rail etiquette, including the ones mentioned here.

Be nice

The metro rail is new, and people are still getting used to the crowd and the rush that comes with it.<br>
 Being nice to fellow commuters, helping them when possible, and trying to accommodate other people to the best of one's ability are basic niceties that will make using the metro a finer prospect for everyone.

The incident resulted in approximately 15 minutes of disruption to metro rail services starting from around 12:10pm, metro rail officials said.

The service resumed after staffers removed the satellite TV cable from the power line, Siddique said.


After suspension of the service, many passengers were seen waiting in crowds at various stations. Some trains were instructed to slow down while others were stopped on the line for some time.
